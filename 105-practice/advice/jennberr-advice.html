      <h4>Be true to <span>yourself</span>. Know your worth.</h4>
        <p>Be true to your authenic self. Don't be the person who shifts their ideas and opinions to fit someone else or let people dictate your choices. Be honest with yourself about what you think, want, feel, and need. Find your self-worth in yourself, not through the lens of someone else.</p>

        <h4>Believe in <span>yourself</span></h4>
        <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, believe that you can do it, and don't let anyone tell you different. Don't doubt your ability to learn something new.</p>

        <h4>Don't get <span>discouraged</span></h4>
        <p>Sometimes you will get discouraged especially when things are not going as you think they should. Your are not defeated, just keep putting one foot in front of the other. You will eventually get there.</p>
